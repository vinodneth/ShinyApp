```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Overview    
The  App helps user predict the hp (horse power) when mpg (miles per gallon) is provided as input. A user friendly interface helps user input the mpg to get the predicted hp   

## UI Layer   
The UI has been built using the shiny library. As in figure below UI has provision :    
- input the mpg using slider in the side bar    
- plot which shows the model and data points      
- renders the predicted hp

## Server Layer

The mtcars model available with R is used to build a model using lm function.   
The hp is predicted from this model for input mpg

## Model
The model used at server
```{r, echo=TRUE}
## uses mtcars which is part of R
dim(mtcars)
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
## model build using lm function
model<- lm(hp~mpg,data = mtcars)
## input from ui fed to predict hp  
modelpred<-predict(model,newdata=data.frame(mpg=mpgInput))
  
```
